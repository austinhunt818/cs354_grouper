          and released in the mid-1990s, Ruby places an emphasis on being
          user-friendly with a simple syntax that prioritizes developer
          happiness, productivity and readability. It is dynamically typed, uses
          garbage-collecting, and just-in-time compilation supporting
          object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming styles. Ruby
          is widely recognized for its use in the web development framework Ruby
          on Rails, which simplifies building full stack web applications. Ruby
          on Rails has been used to build big names like Shopify, Twitter,
          Github, Twitch and more. With a strong focus on readability and
          expressiveness, Ruby allows developers to write concise, yet powerful
          code, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced
          programmers alike.
