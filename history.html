        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Ruby was born on February 24th, 1993, as that was the day that creator Yukihiro Matsumoto,
          otherwise referred to as Matz, picked the name Ruby. Matsumoto wanted to design a language
          that combined aspects of his favorite languages, including Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel and Ada.
          Ruby 0.95 was the first public release, coming out in 1995. For about a decade, the language
          was only really popular in Japan. That changed in 2004, when David Heinemeier Hansson introduced
          Ruby on Rails, a web development framework. Rails became very popular for web development throughout
          the 2000's, leveraging the expressiveness of Ruby to make web development more intuitive for developers.
          By 2016, ruby was the 8th most popular programming language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, Ruby's popularity is so-so. With the ever evolving world of web development, Rails
          became less popular for new web apps, and so therefore did Ruby. However, Ruby is still relevant.
          Rails may be less popular than more recent frameworks, but it is still used widely, and is still one
          of the highest paying web technologies. Ruby is still used for its expressiveness and readability, as
          programmers enjoy being able to write concise and expressive programs. Companies such as Airbnb,
          Shopify, and Amazon use Rails for some of their websites. While Ruby's popularity may have dwindled a bit
          in the past decade, the community is still alive and well, and it's clear that Ruby isn't going anywhere
          anytime soon.
